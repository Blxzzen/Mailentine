>*A Valentines Day email service your partner never asked for !*


\
Mailentine is a web service that allows you to send emails to a friend or partner automatically every day. It was developed as a Valentines Day gift, for a person who likes receiving heart felt messages. While Mailentine is developed to be as *"plug and use"* as possible, you will still need your own `.env` file and `message.json` file. This `README` will provide a walkthrough on how to set this service up completely for free.
